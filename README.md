Welcome to the repositorie for my first personal project after finishing my studies 👋

I'm very proud of it so far 🤗 although i know that in a few month it'll become a baseline to measure my progress and reassure myself that I'm going in the right direction ! ✔️

But for now... while I'm not an a accomplished developer, it's been my playground 🧱
